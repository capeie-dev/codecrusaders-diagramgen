The logging and masking library provides an opinionated set of logging configurations alongside a masking utility.

DataFieldConverter:
This class is a logback ClassicConverter implementation that converts data objects passed as arguments to log messages into JSON format. It uses ObjectMapper to convert java objects to JSON.

ErrorCodeConverter:
The ErrorCodeConverter is a custom Logback converter designed to extract error codes from log events that occur at the ERROR level. This converter helps in logging error-specific codes from various exception types, making it easier to identify and diagnose issues in production systems. With the integration of the ErrorCodeConverter, log entries will now include a new field for "errorCode", providing enhanced clarity and facilitating more effective error tracking.

Extracts Error Codes: Retrieves error codes from a variety of exception types, including custom exceptions and custom Error objects.
Supports Multiple Sources: The converter checks both the arguments passed to the log and the throwable (exception) associated with the log to extract the error code.
Supported Exception Types:
Custom Exceptions: Any exception extending the BaseException class, including:

AuthenticationException
BadRequestException
DataNotFoundException
EAPIUnavailableException
ForbiddenException
IntegrationException
InvalidInputException
SystemException
UnprocessableEntityException
VersionConflictException
BaseException
Custom Error Object

Custom error objects, such as the Error object from the com.marriott.platform.framework.model.Error package.
Logback
Contains default patterns for how the logs will be formed when logged
By default, root level logging is set to INFO means it will log messages with a severity level of INFO and above.
This can be overridden by using Spring Boot's logging configuration
Uses "MaskingJsonGeneratorDecorator" provided by Logstash Logback encoder library to mask sensitive data in logs.
Custom implementation of "FieldMasker" to prevent the masking of null values which can be configured by providing the property logback.mask.disable.null-masking in application.properties/application.yml file.
The authorization key, which is specified as a header upon logging in, has been identified for masking by inclusion in a predefined masking pathway.
