S3 provides scalable, durable, and secure storage for various use cases, including storing data for Internet applications, backups, disaster recovery, and data lakes. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Key features of Amazon S3: [6, 7]  

• Object Storage: Data is stored as objects within S3 buckets. [2, 8]  
• Scalability and Durability: S3 can handle virtually any amount of data and is designed for high durability. [3, 5]  
• Storage Classes: Offers different storage classes (e.g., S3 Standard, S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Glacier) to optimize storage costs and performance for various use cases. [6, 9, 10]  
• Access Control: Provides robust access management options, including IAM (AWS Identity and Access Management), bucket policies, and S3 Access Grants, to control who can access and modify S3 resources. [11]
