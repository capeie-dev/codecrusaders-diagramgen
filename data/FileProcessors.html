The purpose of this library is to parse fixed & non fixed length formatted data for CSV/DAT based file data to custom plain java object and vice-versa.

1. With Fixed Length
JRecordBind library is used for Fixed length.

2. Without Fixed Length
OpenCSV library is used to perform read/write operations on/for non-fixed length data (aka where column header data does not contain fixed length)

The implementation of the NonFixedWidthParser component enables reading and writing files supporting CSV/DAT formats without requiring column fixed length specifications.
