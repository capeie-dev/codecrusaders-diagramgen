FileParser is a utility library used to read and extract structured data from common file formats such as CSV, Excel, JSON, and XML. It is commonly used in data ingestion pipelines, ETL processes, import/export features, and file-based API endpoints. FileParser libraries help simplify parsing logic by abstracting low-level IO and schema mapping concerns. [1, 2, 3]

Key Features: [2, 3, 4, 5]

• CSV Parsing: Reads and maps CSV data to POJOs or collections using headers, indexes, or custom schemas. [2, 3]  
• Excel (XLS/XLSX) Support: Parses Microsoft Excel files using libraries like Apache POI or JExcel. [2, 4]  
• JSON Parsing: Converts JSON files into object graphs using Jackson, Gson, or similar mappers. [1, 3]  
• XML Parsing: Uses DOM, SAX, or JAXB-based strategies for XML structure parsing and validation. [1, 5]  
• Schema-Based Mapping: Supports header validation, column ordering, and data type conversion. [2, 4, 5]  
• Streaming and Memory Efficiency: Enables large file handling via buffered readers or streaming APIs. [3, 4]  
• Error Handling and Validation: Detects malformed files, missing fields, and incorrect types with meaningful exceptions. [3, 4]  
• Extensibility: Allows custom format handlers and pre/post-processing hooks. [4, 5]  

Common Use Cases: [2, 3, 4]

• Bulk Data Import: Import user records, product catalogs, configuration files, or financial data from Excel or CSV. [2, 3]  
• ETL Pipelines: Extract data from structured files for transformation and loading into databases or event queues. [3, 5]  
• File-Based API Endpoints: Process user-uploaded files for data onboarding, form processing, or batch processing. [2, 4]  
• Configuration & Migration: Read system setup parameters from YAML, JSON, or XML during startup or migration. [1, 5]  

How it Works: [2, 4]

• Developer configures a parser type (CSV, Excel, etc.) with a schema or mapping.  
• File input is streamed or loaded into memory.  
• Parsed data is validated and transformed into domain objects.  
• Errors are caught and reported per row or batch.  
• Data is forwarded to a service layer, DB, or external API.

Example Usage (Java + CSV):

```java
CsvSchema schema = CsvSchema.builder().addColumn("name").addColumn("age").build();
MappingIterator<User> it = new CsvMapper().readerFor(User.class).with(schema)
    .readValues(new File("users.csv"));

while (it.hasNext()) {
    User user = it.next();
    userService.process(user);
}
